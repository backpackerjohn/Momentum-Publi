# User Journey: Alex's Path to a Predictable Rhythm

This document outlines a typical user journey for "Alex," a creative professional who struggles with executive function challenges like time blindness and task initiation. Alex's goal is to establish a more structured weekly routine and reduce the cognitive load of remembering small but important transitional tasks.

---

### Part 1: First Contact - Laying the Foundation

**Scenario:** Alex has just downloaded the Momentum app. They feel their weeks are chaotic and are looking for a tool to bring some order.

1.  **Entry Point:** Alex opens the app and navigates to the **Calendar** page for the first time.
2.  **The Greeting:** Instead of an empty grid, Alex is greeted by the **Onboarding Wizard**. The message is welcoming: "Let's set up your weekly rhythm." Alex feels relieved that they don't have to figure it out from a blank slate.
3.  **Defining the Core Block:** The wizard asks Alex about their main weekly commitment, like work or school. Alex enters "Work," selects "9:00 AM" to "5:00 PM," and taps the buttons for Monday through Friday.
4.  **Setting Boundaries:** Next, the wizard asks about "Do Not Disturb" hours. Alex chooses the default "11 PM - 7 AM" window, feeling a sense of control over when they will *not* be bothered.
5.  **The Reveal:** Alex confirms the setup. The wizard closes, and the Calendar page is now populated with their "Work" **Anchors**â€”solid, predictable blocks from Monday to Friday. For the first time, their week has a visible structure. This simple view reduces their anxiety immediately.

### Part 2: Creating the First "Smart" Reminder

**Scenario:** It's Monday morning. Alex almost forgot to review their notes for the 9 AM stand-up meeting again. They realize they need a prompt *before* work starts.

1.  **The Idea:** "I need a reminder about 15 minutes before I start working."
2.  **The Action:** On the Calendar page, Alex clicks the **"Add Reminder"** button.
3.  **The Form:** A simple modal appears.
    -   For "Anchor," Alex selects **"Work"** from a dropdown list.
    -   For "When," they choose **"15 minutes before"** the anchor starts.
    -   For "Message," they type: `Review daily tasks & grab coffee`.
4.  **The Confirmation:** Alex saves the reminder. The app provides a confirmation toast: `Reminder set: "Review daily tasks & grab coffee" 15 minutes before Work on Weekdays.`
5.  **The Result:** Alex can now see small "Bell" icons attached to each "Work" anchor on the calendar, visually confirming that their new automated prompt is in place for the entire week.

### Part 3: Effortless Creation with AI

**Scenario:** Later, Alex is thinking about their fitness goals. They consistently forget to pack their gym clothes, which often leads to skipping their workout.

1.  **The Idea:** "I wish the app could just remind me to get my gym stuff ready."
2.  **The Action:** Alex clicks the floating **AI Chat** button.
3.  **The Conversation:** Alex types a simple, natural language request: `remind me to pack my gym bag 30 minutes before my Gym Session`.
4.  **The Magic:** The AI assistant processes the request and responds: `Got it! I've set a reminder to "Pack gym bag" for 30 minutes before your "Gym Session" anchor.` A confirmation card appears in the chat, showing the new reminder's details.
5.  **The Result:** Without navigating complex menus, Alex has created another crucial, context-aware reminder. They feel supported, not managed.

### Part 4: The Payoff - The Nudge in Action

**Scenario:** It's Tuesday morning. The system Alex set up is about to pay off.

1.  **The Prompt:** At 8:45 AM, a notification appears on Alex's phone. On the app's **Today Page**, a card for the reminder "Review daily tasks & grab coffee" is active. It includes the "why" text: *So you feel prepared and on top of your tasks.*
2.  **The Action:** The gentle nudge is perfectly timed. Alex isn't deep in another task yet. They grab their coffee, review their notes, and feel prepared for the day. They tap "Done" on the reminder.
3.  **Seamless Transition:** Later that day, 30 minutes before their scheduled workout, the "Pack gym bag" reminder appears. The prompt arrives when they are wrapping up work, providing the perfect cue to transition to their next activity. They pack their bag and successfully make it to the gym.

### Conclusion

Through this journey, Alex has transformed their chaotic week into a structured, predictable rhythm. By using **Anchors** to define their core routine and **Smart Reminders** to handle the small transitional tasks, they have offloaded significant cognitive work. The system doesn't just nag them; it prompts them at the most effective moments, helping them build momentum and turn intention into action.
